# Space Invaders in Processing

I created this Space Invaders game in Processing, an introductory language for new programmers. The project was inspired by a task on Upwork, and I utilized the Processing environment to implement the classic Space Invaders gameplay. 

## Demo

[Watch the demo here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81827619/126921203-6bbda4e3-e636-4bd8-93d8-b68479ec5742.mp4)

## Features

- Classic Space Invaders gameplay with player control, enemy movement, and shooting mechanics.
- Dynamic grid layout for enemies, creating the classic invader formation.
- Player spaceship with health, shooting ability, and movement controls.
- Enemy spaceships with different health levels and firing capabilities.
- Shields to provide cover for the player from enemy bullets.
- Score tracking to keep count of your achievements.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) installed on your machine.
2. Open the `Space_Invaders.pde` file in the Processing IDE.
3. Click the "Run" button in the IDE to launch the game.

## Controls

- **Left Arrow Key:** Move the player spaceship left.
- **Right Arrow Key:** Move the player spaceship right.
- **Control Key:** Shoot bullets.

## Acknowledgments

- The initial code structure was built upon [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ihavenonickname/5cc5b9b1d9b912f704061a241bc096ad). I adapted and extended it to fit my coding style and requirements.
- The project involved learning and practicing Processing concepts, including drawing, object-oriented programming, and game mechanics.
